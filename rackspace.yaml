  Multiple Linux servers running [Apache Cassandra
  2.0](http://cassandra.apache.org/).

  This configuration will build a single seed server with two or more
  additional Cassandra nodes.

  #### Getting Started
  If you're new to Cassandra, check out the [Cassandra Getting
  Started](http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/GettingStarted) guide. This
  document covers the basics for starting to use your new Cassandra multinode
  cluster. Client connections should be made to the IP address associated with
  the eth1 interface of each server. Example:

  ```bash
  root@cassandra-seed:~# cqlsh 10.176.203.154
  Connected to 4b1a2eb6-5b7d-48e4-a4bc-640a8f478bb0 at 10.176.203.154:9160.
  [cqlsh 4.1.1 | Cassandra 2.0.11 | CQL spec 3.1.1 | Thrift protocol 19.39.0]
  Use HELP for help.
  cqlsh>
  ```

  The cluster name will be the same as your stack ID.

  #### Logging In via SSH
  The private key provided in the passwords section can be used to login as
  root via SSH. We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).
